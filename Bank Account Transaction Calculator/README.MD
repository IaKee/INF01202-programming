# Program Description

This program calculates the updated balance of a bank account after three operations, given the initial balance and the values of each operation.

The program first prompts the user to enter the initial balance of the account. Then, it asks for the values of the three operations in sequence. After each operation, it calculates the updated balance and displays it to the user.

If the updated balance becomes negative at any point during the operations, the program prints a warning message to the user.

The program takes input and outputs data through the standard input/output streams, using the scanf() and printf() functions provided by the stdio.h library.

Note: The program seems to have a typo in some of the scanf() function calls, as it has an extra space before the format specifier %.2f. This could cause issues when reading the input values.
