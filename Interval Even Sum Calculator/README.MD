# Program Description

This program calculates the sum of even numbers within a given interval. The program prompts the user to enter two integer values that represent the lower and upper bounds of the interval.

After reading the input, the program uses a for loop to iterate over all numbers between the two bounds. If the current number is even (i.e., the remainder of the number divided by 2 is zero), the program adds it to a running sum.

Finally, the program prints the sum of all even numbers within the interval.

Note that this program uses the standard input/output library stdio.h and declares integer variables valor_n1, valor_n2, menorval, maiorval, soma, and contador to store the user input and calculate the sum.
