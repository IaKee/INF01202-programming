# Program Description

This program is a practical exercise that generates an array of 5 random numbers and calculates their mean value. Then, it displays the values that are either greater than or smaller than the mean.

The program starts by initializing an array of five floating-point values named aleatorios. It then proceeds to fill up the array by prompting the user to enter a value for each position of the array. The values are stored in the array and the sum of all elements is calculated.

The mean value is obtained by dividing the sum of all values by the number of values in the array.

After calculating the mean value, the program displays the values that are less than or equal to the mean value and those that are greater than the mean value. The program iterates over each element in the array and compares it to the mean value. If the value is less than or equal to the mean value, it is printed to the console. Similarly, if the value is greater than the mean value, it is also printed to the console.

Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful completion.
