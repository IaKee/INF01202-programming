# Calculator of Averages

This program calculates the average of three integer values entered by the user and counts how many of the values are greater than or equal to the calculated average.

The program begins by initializing variables valor1, valor2, valor3, quantosiguais, and media. The user is then prompted to enter three integer values, which are stored in the variables valor1, valor2, and valor3.

The program calculates the average of the three values using the formula media = ((valor1+valor2+valor3)/3) and stores the result in the variable media.

The program then checks each value to see if it is greater than or equal to the calculated average. If a value is greater than or equal to the average, the variable quantosiguais is incremented by 1.

Finally, the program prints out the number of values that are greater than or equal to the average.

Overall, this program is a simple example of how to calculate averages and count values that meet certain conditions in C programming.
