# Program Description

This program calculates the sum and average of N values entered by the user. It starts by prompting the user to input the number of values to be calculated (N), and then asks the user to input N values. It then calculates the sum and average of the N values and displays the result on the screen.

## How the program works
- The program starts by displaying a message to the user indicating what the program does.
- The program prompts the user to enter the number of values to be calculated (N).
- The program checks if the value of N is valid (i.e., it should be a positive integer). If the value of N is not valid, the program displays an error message and terminates.
- The program uses a for loop to prompt the user to enter N values and calculate their sum.
- The program then calculates the average of the N values by dividing the sum by N.
- Finally, the program displays the sum and average of the N values on the screen.

## Example

Suppose the user wants to calculate the sum and average of 5 values. The program will display the following:

```C
Calculador de soma e media de N valores

Informe a quantidade de valores que deseja calcular: 5

Informe o valor 1: 10
Informe o valor 2: 20
Informe o valor 3: 30
Informe o valor 4: 40
Informe o valor 5: 50

Soma dos valores: 150
Media dos valores: 30
```

In this example, the program prompts the user to enter 5 values, and then calculates the sum and average of these values. The sum of the values is 150, and their average is 30.
