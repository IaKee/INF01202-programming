# Program Description

This program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

The program prompts the user to enter the number of terms they wish to see in the sequence. If the user enters a number less than 1, the program will print an error message indicating that the input must be a positive integer.

The program uses two variables, n_ant and n_prox, to store the two previous numbers in the sequence. It initializes these variables to 1 because the first two numbers in the sequence are both 1. It then calculates and prints the next number in the sequence until it reaches the specified number of terms.

If the user enters a very large number (greater than or equal to 10000), the program prints a message indicating that it may take a while to generate the sequence.

This program demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, and variables in C programming.
