# POA Interview

## Program Description

This program is an exercise of a job interview in Porto Alegre. It collects data from interviewees and keeps track of some statistics. The program asks the user to continue the interview, the interviewee's favorite soccer team (1-Gremio, 2-Inter, 3-Others), their average salary, and the city of origin (1-POA or 2-Others).

The program keeps track of the number of people interviewed, the number of Gremio fans, the number of Inter fans, and the number of interviewees from POA or other cities. It also calculates the average salary of Gremio fans and the average salary of Inter fans.
